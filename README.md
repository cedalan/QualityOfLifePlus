# QualityOfLifePlus
A minecraft plugin specifically made for my friends and I.

## How to install:
Clone repo to your machine and modify build_and_copy.sh according to the instructions in the script. Then run
```
./build_and_copy.sh
```
to build and copy the file into your plugins folder. If you are on windows I suggest you use WSL or Git bash:)
If for some reason the script is not marked as excecutable after cloning this repo, run:
```
chmod +x build_and_copy.sh
```
and then 
```
./build_and_copy.sh
```
